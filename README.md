csv2sqlite
==========

Does what it says; converts csvs to sqlite tables

*Why*? None of the other solutions were quite as clean and simple as I would like.

```
csv2sqlite data.csv database.db tablename
```

It handles creation of databases, tables, type inference, inserting, etc. Not flashy but it works.

Install directly from the git repo
```
pip install git+https://github.com/perrygeo/csv2sqlite.git
```
